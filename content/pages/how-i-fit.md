## Big Data, Small Team 
I got my start as a full stack developer, which laid a strong general foundation across many tools and technologies. However, over time I have specialized more and more in the backend, including a lot of exposure in DevOps roles, but particularly in roles working with data. 

What this means is that I am uniquely equipped to work well in small teams that can't afford to hire a specialist for every role, but also can't afford to hire someone who doesn't know what they're doing, which will cost even more in the long run when it's time to scale up. Let me design and implement your data pipelines, database infrastructure, hosting, cloud services, api server, frontend code, data visualizations, or all of the above.

**Working on your MVP?**
I can build your data-intensive project from the ground up, quickly but in a scalable way so that it is ready to grow as the project grows. 

**Already have a working MVP and ready to add more?**
I will learn your code and dive in from day one. I prefer best practices but prefer maintaining consistency with an existing codebase even more.

## Flexible and Agile
I am known for simply getting the job done regardless of the difficulty or whether I have ever done anything like it before. I have worked well with business partners, product managers, scrum masters and other roles and can be flexible as to what is needed for an effort, project, or iterative release. 

I have worked within Scrum and Kanban workflows with team tools such as Slack, Trello, Jira, Github, and Bitbucket.

## Globally Distributed
I am experienced in working remotely across time zones and across cultures. I grew up in Seattle, studied in Los Angeles, sojourned in Spokane, but live in Phnom Penh. Some see hiring remote workers as a necessary evil, but on the contrary I have found that remote teams, when done right, are often more productive than their in-office counterparts. 

To be frank, I find it surprising that teams who understand the benefits of a distributed database refuse to embrace a distributed workforce. 

If you feel the same way, I'd love to learn more about what you're working on and how I can help.

## Not convinced, or just want to learn more?

[Contact me](mailto:quey.ryan@gmail.com), and I can send you my references. I am confident that they will back up what I claim and more. On every project that I've worked on, I have left on good terms and often with an open invitation to work on the project again when availability allows. I have nothing to hide, and am confident that my references will affirm the value that I can add to your team.
