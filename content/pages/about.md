I am a full stack data engineer, specializing in managing and manipulating data at scale and integrating that into your app, from front to back. 

I most enjoy my work when learning something new and challenging. 

My education background includes two masters degrees. My studies involved mastering multiple languages and reading and writing highly technical works with precision. Research projects involved searching out every angle in order to resolve every dilemma, all before the deadline. I bring this same level of precision, critical thinking, and work ethic to software development as well. 

Professional interests include all things data, but especially health care use cases for AI/machine learning. 

Occasionally I write technical blog posts, which you can find [here on Medium](https://medium.com/@rlquey2).
