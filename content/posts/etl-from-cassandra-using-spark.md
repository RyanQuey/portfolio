description: "Cassandra DB performs writes fast and leaves read-heavy work to 3rd-party integrations. For example, Elassandra solves this with Elasticsearch and Datastax solves this with Solr and Spark (or even Graph depending on the use case). Of course, we could also integrate Cassandra with these same tools using open source connectors and drivers. Check out an example of how to extract your Cassandra into Spark for an ETL pipeline."
