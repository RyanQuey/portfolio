description: "It is one thing to perform ETL on data originating from a single data source, but it is quite another to work with data coming in from different sources who have different APIs, different data formats, different error handling policies...we can stop there, but I believe the point is made. Check out this example of how to manage data coming in from separate origins, which in this case was different social media platforms."

# The front and server actually did a lot of the direct communication with social media platforms using passport, but really it was stored on our end using our sails backend
