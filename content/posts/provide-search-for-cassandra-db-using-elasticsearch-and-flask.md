description: "Your data won't help you if you don't know how to use it. One way is to allow end-users (or admins) to search through your data. Elassandra integrates Elasticsearch with your Cassandra DB for near instant search results and a REST API. One way to access that REST API is by connecting to it through a React app, with a Flask app server in the middle to handle requests. Click here to get an idea for how I can build a similar solution for your app."
