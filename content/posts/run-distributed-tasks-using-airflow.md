description: "Airflow makes it easy to manage complicated data pipelines and run them in a distributed cluster. Airflow does this by letting users create DAGs that run and track batch jobs as they run across multiple stages. In this demo, I hook up Airflow running on a Docker container to my podcast analysis tool."
