description: "A major strength of a full-stack data engineer is the ability to bring the entire stack together, coordinating all of your microservices and features into a single product. Any developer can slap a new feature onto your project, but if new features aren't seamlessly integrated into your project as a whole, they will run inefficiently and slow down future development. See how everything can work together, from data pipeline to web app to data visualization and user-facing search functionality."
