description: "Elassandra makes it easy to quickly and easily use Cassandra together with Elasticsearch, allowing us to take advantage of the strength of each. With a simple NodeJS server on top of that, and tools like React and Searchkit, we can access and display our data whether it originated in Cassandra or Elasticsearch. If you have a Cassandra cluster and want to add greater querying power, or on the other hand have Elasticsearch and want to pair it with the capabilities of Cassandra, itâ€™s definitely worth giving Elassandra a look."
